# Qwen AI Free Service

## Project Description

<span>[ <a href="README.md">中文</a> | English ]</span>

This project is modified from [https://github.com/LLM-Red-Team/qwen-free-api](https://github.com/LLM-Red-Team/qwen-free-api), thanks to the great contribution!
**Important**: The original project contains malicious code due to supply chain attacks. It is strongly recommended not to continue using it.

**Modifications:**
1. The original project's official interface modifications caused answer disorder, making the API basically unusable
2. The original project author rarely updates anymore
3. The malicious code included in the original project has been removed, and the source code of this project is welcome for review

## Update Notes

1. Modified `chat.ts` to fix non-streaming output interface methods, referring to the original project issue [返回的消息带错乱](https://github.com/LLM-Red-Team/qwen-free-api/issues/72)

2. Updated `models.ts` model list to support the latest models such as qwen3-235b-a22b, qwen3-coder-plus, qwen-plus-latest, etc.

3. Rebuilt the Docker image with the new version: `akashrajpuroh1t/qwen-free-api-fix:latest`

4. Fixed malicious code issues in the source code and rebuilt it. Verification as follows:

- The obfuscated code was included at the end of `src/api/chat.js` file, and after building, it appears in the container at `/app/dist/index.js` file around line 1871, as shown in the red box below:
![index.js](./doc/index.js.png)

- After fixing, the obfuscated code was removed, and after building, it appears in the container at `/app/dist/index.js` file around line 1951, as shown below:
![index-fix.js](./doc/index-fix.js.png)

**Models tested successfully:**

## Access Preparation

### Method 1

Login from [Tongyi Qianwen](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/qianwen)

Enter Tongyi Qianwen and start any conversation, then press F12 to open developer tools, find the value of `tongyi_sso_ticket` from Application > Cookies. This will be used as the Authorization Bearer Token value: `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`

![Get tongyi_sso_ticket](./doc/example-0.png)

### Method 2

Login from [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.aliyun.com/) (not recommended if the account has important assets like servers). If the account has never entered [Tongyi Qianwen](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/qianwen) before, you need to first enter and agree to the protocol, otherwise it will not take effect.

Then press F12 to open developer tools, find the value of `login_aliyunid_ticket` from Application > Cookies. This will be used as the Authorization Bearer Token value: `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`

![Get login_aliyunid_ticket](./doc/example-7.png)

### Multi-account Access

You can provide multiple account `tongyi_sso_ticket` or `login_aliyunid_ticket` separated by commas:

`Authorization: Bearer TOKEN1,TOKEN2,TOKEN3`

The service will select one from them for each request.

## Docker Deployment

## API List

Currently supports OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` interface. You can use it with OpenAI or other compatible clients, or use online services like [dify](https://dify.ai/) for integration.
